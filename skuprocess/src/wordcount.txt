In my hometown, the old people get used to eat animals, like dog. I feel so sorry for them, because dogs are our friends in my heart, so I refuse to eat animals, such as dogs and cats. I have a pet cat. I take care of her all the time and we are close friends. My belief is strong and I won¡¯t change
